**Galaxy Throne**

a fully on-chain SciFi Strategy Game.

We wanted to create an immersive SciFi Strategy Building Game where your owned planets & ships are actually yours, not just existing on a centralized backend and dictated by one company.

Every Asset in our game has been created using **ERC721** for planets and ships, while the resources of the game itself are **ERC20** tokens.

A **Governance DAO** exists via snapshot.org and the ownership of 1 planet NFT

We are utilizing Chainlinks Verifiable Random Function to randomize planet generation & the assignment of the home planet as well as for dynamic fights.

In order to avoid frequent transactions & user gas-fees we leveraged our own in-house automation framework, for a gasless & seamless user experience.

We are utilizing the **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard**: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535 to offer upgradable, limitless contract
